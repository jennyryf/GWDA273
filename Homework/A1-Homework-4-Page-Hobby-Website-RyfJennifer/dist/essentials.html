        <h1>Equestrian Essentials</h1>
      <p>You’ll probably decide to ride either English or western, and this will help you decide what type of essentials to buy. To ensure that you enjoy a comfortable and safe horse-riding experience, it’s important that you equip yourself with the right riding gear essentials. Here are 5 most important horse-riding essentials that you must have for horse-riding adventures:</p>
    <h2>Riding Hat</h2>

    <p>Starting from the most important essential, having a sturdy quality riding hat is an absolute must for you to wear whenever you are riding horses or even if you are just around horses handling them. It doesn’t matter if you’re an experienced horse-rider, a riding hat or helmet is necessary to protect the skull and brain from injuries in case of any unforeseen accidents or circumstances. In fact, if you find that your hat has suffered from an impact due to a fall, then you should replace it immediately.</p>
    <h2>Jodhpurs or Breeches</h2>
        <img src="img/pants.jpg" alt="Pants">
    <p>Don’t wear jeans or trousers to your horse-riding sessions. Jodhpurs and breeches are the specially designed apparels to be worn for horse-riding. They allow to comfortably sit in the saddle and prevent any skin chafing or irritation on the leg while riding. Jodhpurs ensure a safe, comfortable and flexible sitting experience.</p>
    <h2>Riding Boots</h2>
        <img src="img/boots.jpg" alt="Boots">
    <p>Boots play a very important role in riding. They could be instrumental in protecting your toes, ankles and shins from injuries. Hence, you should have at least one pair of high-quality riding footwear, whether it’s the short Jodhpur boots or the long ones. Make sure that the boots you buy are designed for the riding activity, because there are also plenty of yard boots for horseriders that are just suitable for the ground activities. The heels of the riding boots should be about 1 inch high.</p>
    <h2>Coats, Jackets and Vests</h2>

   <p> You should wear a coat or a jacket in addition to the top or shirt that you wear during horseriding.</p>
    <p>Weather conditions can be unpredictable. Wearing a coat or a jacket ensures a certain level of protection from the wind and rain. Just make sure you’re your coat/jacket doesn’t hinder your arm and shoulder movements and that it doesn’t flutter around at the time of riding. You may even wear a safety vest if you want to be extra-cautious and prevent injuries.</p>
    <h2>Gloves</h2>

    <p>Riding gloves don’t just look stylish but they also serve very practical purposes. Firstly, they help in keeping the hands warm in cold, harsh weather conditions. Secondly, they help in maintaining a proper grip on the reins so that your hand doesn’t slip from the rains. Thirdly, they protect your hands from friction burns, blisters, against falls, etc.</p>

        <h1>Horse Essentials</h1>
      <p>Once you get a horse, you'll need a few basic pieces of equipment so you can care for it properly, and of course enjoy the activity that you bought it for whether that be riding or driving. Many of the things you may already own if you have a country property. The pitchforks, wheelbarrows and shovels used for cleaning up after horses are the same as you'd buy in any hardware store for gardening or other yard work.</p>
    <p>There are some specialty items you'll need to pick up at your local tack shop, such as special brushes and the tack for riding and driving. Some of the items, like feed and water troughs can be made of re-purposed buckets and barrels. Just be sure there were no toxic substances stored in them, that they're well cleaned out and have no sharp edges.</p>
    <p>Although bits, bridles and saddles might be something you're excited to acquire before you bring your horse home, it might be best to wait. That way, you'll be able to custom fit your horse, keeping it comfortable and happy. Other items like brushes, buckets and lead ropes can be purchased well ahead of time, so they’re waiting for your horse when it arrives. You should also have several weeks supply of hay and any supplements or grain you should feed your horse. Your fences and stable should be ready. You’ll need some type of bedding if your horse will be stabled at all, and of course, you’ll need a good supply of fresh water.</p>
        <p>Here are the items you will need if you plan to care for and use your horse:</p>
