      <h1>Riding Disciplines</h1>
      <p>Horseback riding is generally split between Western riding and English riding, with the saddle itself being the biggest difference between the two. But how many other styles and of riding are there? Here we list some of the different disciplines of riding in use today.</p>
    <h2>Dressage</h2>
        <img src="img/Dressage.jpg" alt="Dressage">
    <p>The purpose of dressage is to develop a horse’s natural athletic ability and willingness to work, which is supposed to make them calm, supple, and attentive to the rider. An extreme form of dressage is the famous Lippizaner stallions from Vienna, Austria.</p>
    <h2>Eventing</h2>
        <img src="img/Eventing.jpg" alt="Eventing">
    <p>Eventing is a competition that includes dressage, cross-country riding, and stadium jumping, usually over the course of 3 days.</p>
    <h2>Show jumping</h2>
        <img src="img/Show jumping.jpg" alt="Show jumping">
    <p>Show jumping is divided into 3 different classes: hunter, jumper, and hunt seat equitation. Hunters are judged by how closely they meet an ideal standard of manners and style. Jumpers are scored objectively in a timed trial with faults for failing to clear an obstacle. Hunt seat jumping judges the rider’s ability on flat ground as well as over fences.</p>
    <h2>Western pleasure</h2>
        <img src="img/Western pleasure.jpg" alt="Western pleasure">
    <p>In Western Pleasure competition, horses are evaluated on the quality of their movement while traveling the perimeter of the arena with other contestants. They follow the judge’s directions to walk, jog, lope, and reverse directions.</p>
        <h2>Racing</h2>
        <img src="img/Racing.jpg" alt="Racing">
    <p>Racing is one of the richest sports in the world and is often referred to as “the sport of
    kings.” Jockeys have to be very fit both physically and mentally to stay atop an animal
    moving at 44 miles per hour. This list was neither exhaustive nor detailed, but it gives you an idea of the wide variety of ways in which people get pleasure from riding horses.</p>
    <h2>Polo</h2>
        <img src="img/Polo.jpg" alt="Polo">
    <p>Sport with two opposing teams of four riders who play on a level field; they try to score
    points through the opponents’ goal by hitting a ball along the ground with a mallet.</p>

     <h2>Reining</h2>
        <img src="img/Reining.jpg" alt="Reining">
    <p>Often described as the Western version of dressage, in reining competition riders guide
    horses through a precise pattern of circles, spins, and stops. All work is done at a lope (a
    more relaxed version of a canter) or a gallop (the fastest horse gait). The horse should be
    controlled with little or no apparent resistance.</p>
    <h2>Barrel racing</h2>
        <img src="img/Barrel racing.jpg" alt="Barrel racing">
    <p>In barrel racing, a horse and rider attempt to complete a pattern around barrels placed in a
    triangle in the center of an arena in the fastest time.</p>
        <h2>Cutting</h2>
        <img src="img/Cutting.jpg" alt="Cutting">
    <p>Cutting is a rodeo-style event in which horse and rider work together to demonstrate the
    horse’s ability to herd and single out cattle. This was a necessity on ranches to single out
    cattle for branding or other veterinary interventions.</p>
    <h2>Endurance</h2>
        <img src="img/Endurance.jpg" alt="Endurance">
    <p>Endurance rides put an emphasis on the overall health of a horse with a ride that is
    between 25 and 500 miles. There are health checks every 25 miles or so to ensure the
    health of both the horse and the rider.</p>
    <h2>Gymkhana</h2>
        <img src="img/Gymkhana.jpg" alt="Gymkhana">
    <p>Gymkhana is timed obstacle riding on horseback with a variety of different individual and
    team events which display the speed, agility, control, and responsiveness of the horse.</p>
    <h2>Saddle seat</h2>
        <img src="img/Saddleseat.jpg" alt="Saddle seat">
    <p>Saddle seat competition was designed to show off the high trotting tendencies of breeds
    such as the American Saddlebred, Morgan, and Arabian. The horse is judged on its elegant
    movement at a walk, trot, and canter.</p>
